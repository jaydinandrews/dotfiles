## Dotfiles
Collection of my config dotfiles. They are a mixed of stolen, borrowed, self-developed, and modified configs. I've attempted to keep headers in most of the files with the original authors but some might be missing.

**HEAVILY** based on the structure and configs of [d4r1us-drk (Clay Gomera)](https://github.com/d4r1us-drk/dotfiles).
